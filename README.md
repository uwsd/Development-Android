- **The Comprehensive Android Developer Bootcamp**<br>
By Paulo Dichone, May 2020, [Packtpub eBook](https://subscription.packtpub.com/video/mobile/9781800561083)<br><br>
My first impressions led me to a fast wrong evaluation. In the Installationsvideo for Android Studio I saw the version 2.3.1 and the first example seems too made with an old version. So I mistakenly concluded that the course uses the old 2.x version. But in reality the author uses the version 3.1.<br>
I do it with the actual version 4.0 (May 2020) and I will tell you later if I reach the deeper chapters, whether it is worth to work with this course. I'm just in the beginning chapters with introduction in Java. The examples are compatible to version 4.0 and so self for an absolute beginner to understand.
